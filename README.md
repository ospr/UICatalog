UIPlayground
============

A collection of user interfaces seen in iOS written in Swift.

See [Todo](UIPlayground/Todo.md) for a list of improvements.

**Note:** Some of the animations (eg Spring Board) take snapshots of the views before animating them. There is a bug in the iOS Simulator where this can cause a white flicker during the animation and/or an entirely white view (Radars rdar://28808781 and rdar://28807303). To see the animation behave properly, run it directly on an iOS device.
